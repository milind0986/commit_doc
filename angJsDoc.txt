ng-route is developed by the angularJS Team for routing.

ng-route: url (Location) based routing.

Ex:

$routeProvider
    .when("/home", {
        templateUrl : "home.html"
    })
ui-route:
--routing
ui-router is develoepd by 3rd party module.

ui-router : state based routing

Ex:

 $stateProvider
        .state('home', {
            url: '/home',
            templateUrl: 'home.html'
        })
--> ui-router allows for nested views

--> ui-router more powerful than ng-route
